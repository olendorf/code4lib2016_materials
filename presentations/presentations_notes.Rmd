## Getting Started

### Install Necessary Packages.

There are a number of options for creating presentations. We will use the **_Slidify_** package, mostly because it has the nicest set of themes. You can get more documentation at [slidify.org](http://slidify.org/).

In the **_Packages_** tab at the lower left, install and require the **_devtools_** package. This will allow us to install the most current **_Slidify_** from Github. 

```
  > install_github('ramnathv/slidify')
  > install_github('ramnathv/slidifyLibraries')
```
### Author The Slide Deck

**_Slidify_** uses the command line to start initialize the slide deck.

```
  > author("new_slides")
```
