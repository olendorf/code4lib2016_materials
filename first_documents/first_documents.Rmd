R Studio makes getting started with Knitr easy. Lets start a  new project and call it **_cars_**. In the **[File]** menu choose **[New Project]**, **[New Directory]**, **[Empty Project]** and call it **_cars_**. Go ahead and make it a git repository too.

For our first document, we'll just play with the default markdown document that R Studio makes for us. Again in the **[File]** menu select **[New File]/R Mardkown**. Call it **_cars_** as well and choose HTML output. It should have created something like below, although I've added some addional comments.

```r

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Three backticks starts a codeblock in Markdown. In markdown we can typically specify 
# the language to allow syntax highlighting. In Knitr we additonally wrap the language 
# specification in curly braces.
`` ` ``{r} # Hard to escape backticks 
summary(cars)
`` ` ``

You can also embed plots, for example:

# Code blocks in Knitr have options. In this case, we display the results without
# the code using the echo=FALSE options
`` ` ``{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
`` ` ``


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```

Now click the **[Knit HTML]** Button at the top of the **_cars.Rmd_** script and it will create the .html file and open it up in a preview panel. Just because you chose HTML when you set it up doesn't mean you are stuck either. You can also choose more by using the down caret on the side of the button. Go ahead and make PDF and Word documents if you like.
